            <h1>Beirut</h1>
            <p>
            Often called "Paris of the Middle East", Beirut is a thriving hotspot for shopping, socializing and sightseeing,
            despite many wars and unrest.<br>
            The city has been rebuilt several times, with modern architecture sharing space with Ottoman and colonial French
            buildings.<br>
            Bustling streets such as Hamra and Ashrafieh provide hopping nightlife while the National Museum and the Gibran
            Museum give visitors a taste of the city's history.<br>
            The Corniche is the place for activities like jogging and biking.

        <h1>Baalbek</h1>
        <p>
        Baalbek is the site of one of the most mysterious ruins of the Roman Empire, a monumental two-thousand-year-old
        temple to Jupiter that sits atop three thousand-ton stone blocks (the pillars of Stonehenge weigh about a
        fortieth of that).<br>
        The blocks originated in a nearby limestone quarry, where a team from the German Archaeological Institute, in
        partnership with Jeanine Abdul Massih, of Lebanese University, recently discovered what they are calling the
        largest stone block from antiquity, weighing one thousand six hundred and fifty tons and matching those that
        support the temple.<br>
        Its provenance is more shadowy than one might expect of a three-million-pound megalith.<br>
        Nobody seems to know on whose orders it was cut, or why, or how it came to be abandoned.<br>

        <h1>Byblos</h1>
        <p>
        The ruins of many successive civilizations are found at Byblos, one of the oldest Phoenician cities.<br>
        Inhabited since Neolithic times, it has been closely linked to the legends and history of the Mediterranean
        region for thousands of years.<br>
        Byblos is also directly associated with the history and diffusion of the Phoenician alphabet.

        <h1>Sidon</h1>
        <p>
        Set amid thick citrus and banana groves, the port town of Saida, also called Sidon, was once a rich and
        flourishing Phoenician city, with tight trade links to ancient Egypt and a globally renowned glass-making
        industry.<br>
        Later the capital of the Persian satrapy, these days it's best known for its fresh fruit and its sweets (the
        local speciality is a crumbly cookie called senioura).

        <h1>Tyre</h1>
        <p>
        According to legend, purple dye was invented in Tyre.<br>
        This great Phoenician city ruled the seas and founded prosperous colonies such as Cadiz and Carthage, but its
        historical role declined at the end of the Crusades.<br>
        There are important archaeological remains, mainly from Roman times.
